2010-01-12  tksharpless

	  another place.
	  Now panini_general is usable from hugin (slow preview window
	  only - fast still displays garbage, though pano is ok).
	* [r1211] adjust.c: Removed some debug code, reinstated a workaround
	  fix for
	  problems that can produce negative FOV when the requested FOV
	  exceeds the max feasible one. Better FOV control should obviate
	  this; however the fix need not be removed.
	* [r1210] adjust.c, math.c, parser.c, queryfeature.c: First working
	  version of panini_general projection.
	  Tested only with PTmender, not yet under hugin.

	  * c - control point number;
	  * D, Dx, Dy - a control point error (value and orthogonal

	  - Added FastTransform to the dialog.
	  - Updated the dialogs with some of the newer interpolator. TOTO:
	  update correct.c, morpher.c, perspective.c, and remap to use
	  transFormEx instead of the new transform (required to use new
	  interpolators) Requires adding inverse stacks.
	  - Fixed PTCorrect bug that had wrong order of operations on the
	  image stack, Radial, then H & V shift.
	  - updated the default interpolator to _spline36
	  - On Windows changed the default location to store parameters file
	  from app folder to folder and file name
	  %APPDATA%\Panotools\APPNAME.prf. This should make the plugins Vista
	  friendly. Changed the default temp file location to %TEMP%

	  * PTcommon.c (panoCreatePanorama): The calculation of the ROI is
	  not done correctly for circular fisheye images (CFIs). For the
	  time being we will do uncrop processing for CFIs, and cropped
	  processing for everything else. For fisheyes we will create crops
	  in post-processing (it is a hack, but it means everything is
	  consistent).

	  * adjust.c (SetMakeParams): Added some debugging code (and
	  commented it out)

	  working properly when 2 cropping specs were specified in the same
	  command line. For instance, when M=0 was specified any cropping on
	  the image was considered a type C crop. The new behaviour is the
	  following:
	  
	  if M is specified with parameter == 0, then it is ignored

	  pano12.def, tests/ChangeLog, tests/panoAutomateTest.pl,

	  tools/PTblender.c, tools/PTmender.c, tools/PTtiff2psd.c,
	  tools/PTuncrop.c: I revamped the TIFF infrastructure
	  to make it more flexible. It is also more encapsulated.
	  I restarted renaming functions with pano as a prefix.
	  
	  One of the side effects of this change is that we are starting
	  to support ICC profile information in TIFFs and soon it will
	  support other metadata.
	  
	  I updated all the PTtools to use the new functions names and
	  I recreated some test cases.
	  
	  Functionally speaking the only difference in this change
	  is that the process keeps the X and Y resolution in TIFF files
	  (previously is was hardcoded to 150)

	  eliminates problems, but is certainly a step in the right direction.
	  Adding error checking to setCropInformationInTiff function.
	  Removing check for cropped TIFF in uncropTIFF...it is possible for a
	  cropped TIFF to have x and y offset equal to zero, so this check
	  could have caused problems.

	  * Makefile.am (all): Undo the changes below... I decided instead
	  to remove the test directory from the make in the root

	  360/180 one.
	* [r507] tests/simpleStitch/ChangeLog, tests/simpleStitch/Makefile.am,

	* [r491] tools/PTmender.c: Changed behavior for input file name
	  parsing. If the script is specified on the command line with a path
	  (e.g. c:\some\path]myscript.txt), this path was prepended to all of
	  the image names in the script, regardless of whether those image
	  names were also specified with a full qualified path. This change
	  adds a check so that the script path is only prepended to the image
	  names, if the image names don't already contain path information.

2006-05-24  maxlyons

	* [r458] ChangeLog: Cropped TIFF modifications (mostly)
	* [r457] tiff.c: readTIFF. Storing filename of TIFF in im->name.
	* [r456] filter.h: getCropInformation. Adding declaration.
	* [r455] PTcommon.c: All logic has been reworked so that "cropped"
	  TIFF files can be used throughout the stitching process for all
	  currently supported output formats. (Cropped TIFF files are those
	  that are just large enough to contain the remapped image, and the
	  offset/full size information is stored in the TIFF header). Modified
	  functions include ReplaceAlphaChannel, CreateAlphaChannels,
	  AddStitchingMasks, FlattenTIFF, createPanorama. New functions
	  include getCropInformationFromTiff, setFullSizeImageParameters.
	  
	  Simplified ComputeStitchingMask8bits syntax
	  
	  CreatePanorama. Reworked logic to handle intermediate output files
	  and produce final output in various formats. Added logic that
	  decides when to use cropped TIFF as intermediate format based on
	  chosen output format. TODO: this could use some tidy up, and it
	  might be a good idea to have cropped TIFF as the default
	  intermediate format for TIFF_m and TIFF_mask, and include a function
	  to "expand" the cropped TIFFs to full size when finished (if the
	  user requests non-cropped TIFF).
	  
	  Reluctantly commented out calls to TIFFSetWarningHandler and
	  TIFFSetErrorHandler...these cause to GCC to abort, with a series of
	  errors about multiple definition of TIFF functions in libpano and
	  libtiff.
	  
	  Changed title bar of progress dialog to indicate currently
	  processing image number (indexed at 1) and total images to be
	  processed.
	* [r454] file.c: writePSD, writeLayerAndMask, writeChannelData,
	  getImageRectangle, addLayer. Reworked to handle "cropped" files.
	* [r453] ColourBrightness.c, tools/PTmender.c: changed #include syntax

	  * PTcommon.c: Checked return value of each TIFFWriteScanline. It
	  now returns an error when it cannot write to the output (instead of

	  library so the errors are now reported using the PTtools error
	  handler.
	  
	  2006-05-20 dmg <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	  of histograms.
	  (Unknown33): Fixed another bug. I referenced last element as
	  array[n] instead of the correct way array[n-1].
	  (Unknown37): Another bug 2 bugs. I had missed a set of parenthesis
	  in an expression. The next line had a couple of errors too.
