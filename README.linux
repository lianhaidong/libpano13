Readme Sources

This file discribes how to build the library libpano13.so
for the Linux operating system. This library is required
for running any of the Panorama Tools applications (PTStitcher, etc).

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

You need the gcc compiler, libgcj and various imaging libraries: libtiff,
libjpeg and libpng.  Headers for these libraries are required, so you probably
have to install libXXX-dev or libXXX-devel packages too.

(Sun java is NOT required if you have libgcj)

Compilation is straightforward:

./configure
make
make install

If you have downloaded from CVS, you will need to bootstrap the build system
first:

./bootstrap

This distribution of the sources limits processing
of fisheye images to fields of view smaller than
179 degrees. This limit is controlled by the constant
MAX_FISHEYE_FOV in the file filter.h. There
is some controversy regarding the legality of processing
hemispherical images (ie images having 180 degree field
of view) in connection with virtual reality panoramas.
If your application of fisheye lenses is not prohibited
by patents, you can build and use your own unlimited version 
of the library by changing the soure code.
